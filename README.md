# Sports-Ref-Submission

This snippet shows my ability to work with objects, data structures, loops, and logic.  

## My Solution

1. Find the team names by using Javascripts Object.keys() method.
2. Initialize an array for the current row, which we will hold each teams records against opponents.
3. Loop through team name, and each of their opponents.
4. If the team name is equal to the opponent name, skip.
5. Otherwise, push number of wins into the row
6. Push row into the final table
